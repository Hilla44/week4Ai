# Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?


AI-driven code generation tools like GitHub Copilot speed up development by automating repetitive coding, completing code snippets, generating tests, and helping with debugging. Research shows developers can save about 30-55% of their time on tasks such as writing new code, documentation, and repetitive programming. These tools reduce manual effort and improve workflow efficiency, especially for common, standardized tasks in large projects and cloud environments.

## Limitations. 
1. AI-generated code may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, or outdated practices that need human review.
2. The tools struggle with complex logic, domain-specific needs, and multi-file or proprietary projects.
3. Dependence on these tools can erode developer skills and creativity, as AI mainly reuses known patterns rather than creating novel solutions.
4. security concerns, licensing, and ethical issues related to training data and code reuse.

# Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

Supervised learning for bug detection uses labeled data where code is marked as buggy or clean. Models learn from these examples to predict bugs with higher accuracy but need large, costly labeled datasets and may miss new bug types.

Unsupervised learning works without labels, using clustering or anomaly detection to identify unusual code patterns that might be bugs. It requires less manual labeling and can find unknown bugs but usually has lower accuracy and more false positives.

# Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

Without bias mitigation, AI-driven personalization can create restrictive feedback loops. Instead of useful tailoring, this leads to echo chambers, unfair exclusion, and poor recommendations, which erodes user trust.

## 2. Case Study Analysis

AIOps enhances software deployment efficiency by automating manual tasks and enabling proactive issue resolution, resulting in quicker and more reliable deployments. 

# For example, 

1. AI can predict build failures and automatically roll back faulty deployments, reducing downtime and human involvement. 
2. AI can analyze test history to identify likely failure points and prioritize these tests early in the CI/CD pipeline, speeding up developer feedback and deployment cycles. These capabilities illustrate how AIOps            streamlines deployment by reducing errors and accelerating feedback loops.
