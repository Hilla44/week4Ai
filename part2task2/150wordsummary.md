AI greatly improves test coverage compared to manual testing by leveraging intelligent automation and adaptive features. 

Manual testing generally addresses only 30-40% of potential scenarios due to time limits, whereas AI-driven testing reaches 80-90% coverage by automatically creating a wide range of test cases, including edge and boundary cases that might be missed by humans. 

AI algorithms assess application changes and automatically update test scripts when UI elements change, cutting maintenance efforts by 60%. Machine learning models identify high-risk areas that require thorough testing based on past data and recent code updates. 

Additionally, AI supports visual testing by comparing screenshots to identify UI regressions that traditional testing cannot detect. This smart testing approach finds 45% more defects than manual methods while decreasing test execution time by 70%. AI continuously learns from testing outcomes, refining test suites and focusing on critical paths to ensure extensive coverage across various browsers, devices, and user scenarios that are challenging to achieve manually.
