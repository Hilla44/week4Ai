# Potential Biases in the Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, despite its clinical value, raises several ethical concerns when used in a corporate resource allocation system:

### Demographic Representation Biases
- The dataset does not include important demographic indicators such as age, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, which may embed hidden biases.
- Minority populations and different age groups are underrepresented, potentially causing inaccurate risk evaluations.
- Historical data might capture disparities in healthcare access rather than true biological risk factors.

### Clinical Data Biases
- Data collected from a single institution introduces sampling bias, limiting how well the results generalize.
- The focus on tumor morphology in feature selection may ignore environmental or genetic influences.
- Priority labels are mainly based on tumor size and aggression, which may not reflect actual treatment urgency for diverse populations.

### Deployment Context Biases
- In corporate applications, the model might inadvertently target specific employee groups due to implicit data patterns.
- Resource distribution based on predicted priority could perpetuate existing healthcare inequalities.
- Lack of clarity on which features drive decisions may enable discriminatory outcomes.
