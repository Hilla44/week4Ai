# Ethical IBM Framework Implementation

### Transparency Measures
- Provide model cards outlining the intended applications and limitations.
- Use explainable AI (XAI) techniques to analyze how features influence decisions.
- Conduct regular fairness audits involving diverse stakeholders.

### Governance Protocols
- Form an ethics review board to oversee model deployment decisions.
- Implement an appeal mechanism for automated priority assignments.
- Ensure human oversight in allocating critical resources.

### Continuous Monitoring
- Monitor performance gaps among different employee demographics.
- Update models regularly with new data to address past biases.
- Perform ongoing impact evaluations of resource distribution.

By adopting these fairness practices, organizations can reduce algorithmic bias while preserving model effectiveness, promoting fair and transparent resource allocation across all employee groups.
